I also renamed triangle to triangleshooter, blocktriangle to triangledefender, movingtriangle to triangleattacker, and explodetriangle to triangleexploder. I also started to make the actual UI of the game.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Jan 24        </td><td>221,14199</td><td>267,2595</td><td>848,30023 </td><td>I made the buttons for cooldown, otherplace, cost, and health actually do something by coding the behaviour of the game when they are toggled on or off.
